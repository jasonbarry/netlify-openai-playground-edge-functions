[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify/openai-edge-functions)

Note: This demo is built to show the power of Netlify Edge Functions and how easy its to build streaming applications. It was great using ChatGPT-4 to help me with initial set of code, though I did a good bit of improvisation along the way. Please do share use cases you're building with generative AI APIs.
